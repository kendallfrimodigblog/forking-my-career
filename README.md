# Forking my Career

Following Thanksgiving I enrolled in a 3 month, full time data science immersive program with General Assembly. What led me to this decision were the geographical, social, and governmental settings I have found myself in the past 3 years - and a look to the future of automation and roles private and governmental organizations may plan in such a future. Here I outline some of these factors but would like to start on a positive note first.


### Brief history
Though my experience preceding my career may be eclectic, I have held a job for over 10 years now, with no more than a month's time in between work. For some a career shift such as this may represent an existential crisis; however this was a very clear path for me and something I have pre-meditated on for over a year.

Medicine was my choice out of high school, as it was a secure and good paying job, and I excelled in Science from an early age. However I had a strong passion for technology as well, repairing xbox's for friends, building PC's and taking a few computer programming courses, which was my anticipated career path. Due to my general dynamic with teachers in primary education, I did particularly poor in Math classes and the idea I could never find myself in a math based career took hold.

Going through a pre-medical track in my undergraduate studies, studying music, and tutoring 25 hours a week through most of my bachelors program left little room for exploring professions outside my future in medicine. Quite late in this tract, after taking the MCAT and nearing graduation I began to think critically about the state of health care in the United States, ["The Healing of America"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Healing_of_America "") was profoundly influential. It became clear to me that I wasn't ready to embark in a 7 year journey and financial commitment, to function in such a complicated system with incentives I didn't see as particularly genuine.

As I matured I began to understand my skills in math were not deficient, in fact the highest grades I received were in physics, analytical chemistry, and statistics. I went on to tutor these courses and established further confidence in my analytical ability. This led me to Epidemiology, as it combined analysis with understanding larger issues affecting the health of people, something I believed to be relatively absent in medical practice.

### Resilience for the future
My education track was narrow with regards to the programming languages and visualization tools offered, and I entered a career in which the majority of analytical positions exist within government agencies - where I have seen similar trends with regards to outdated norms for applied data-science.

As a result I have not been able to gain the professional development I have sought through my career, and often see examples from other professionals of how embracing open source platforms and machine learning could substantially enhance the impact of my work. One such example was my quest to find a better source for Air Quality data.

In my first year I reviewed countless studies of modeling such data, many of which concluded or followed with quality analysis that indicated high variability between each effort, and was left frustrated that an effective method of using satellite data to estimate air quality had not properly been developed. Then I came to understand the workings of Breezometers["Breezometers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Healing_of_America "") operation, whose data exists on all iPhones weather apps.

My initial thoughts were of grave concern, how could a private group with no publications in the field claim that they had broke through such a seemingly impossible task? And how could this information be in the pockets of millions without being vetted by the research community? That's when I came to understand the power of machine learning.

There are certain research questions us humans simply cannot solve alone, and what may require an entire lifetime of scientific inquiry can be automated in a relatively short period. A good analogy is the issue of protein folding, which has gathered more attention from the public as an unsurmountable question of science that is nearing an answer

I have personally made a concerted effort to bring these tools into the fold of my work, but I have been hindered from a lack of mentors with such skills, and an IT department whom does not wish to embrace modern data architectures.
